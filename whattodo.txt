We are now running everything with the spotipy module in Python to connect with the Spotify API playlist, as javascript was too confusing.

First, we are going to loop over an user's playlist and find a specific one (in this case, the 318 Playlist under my account).
Once a playlist is selected, we will list tracks and put them all into a list. Using this list, we will get the following attributes for each song:

- acousticness
- danceability
- duration
- energy
- instrumentalness
- key
- liveness
- loudness
- mode
- popularity
- speechiness
- tempo
- time_signature
- valence

We will average these values, then using the averaged values along with seed values from the songs, we will generate a list of 10 recommended songs.
We will then continue to play around with such values and find a target that at least partially matches what the Spotify recommended songs are.

For you to do:

The code for above is nearly all done, I can get it done in the next two hours. Can you look into a way to display this data on a webpage? Look up
python API to web interface calls or python API to flask, or anything that can do so.

I'd envision a tool that can give out song analytics and thus, generate 10 recommended songs on a webpage.
